Absolutely! Here's a clean, reusable breakdown of the workflow you followed to locally build and run a Dockerized app, tag the image, and prepare it for Azure Container Registry (ACR):

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Local Docker Build & Compose Setup

1. **Navigate to your project directory**  
   ```sh
   cd ~/downloads/day27-az-terraform/docker-local-deployment
   ```

2. **Export and tag your image during build**  
   Docker used BuildKit to export the backend image and tag it as `latest`:
   ```sh
   # Typically managed by your build setup
   # Resulting image: prodr9acosacrr9acos.azurecr.io/backend:latest
   ```

3. **Create and start containers with Docker Compose**  
   Set a default image tag (useful for CI/CD) and spin up services:
   ```sh
   CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG=latest docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This launches:
   - Backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL containers
   - A named Docker network (`goal-tracker-network`)
   - A persistent volume for Postgres data

### üöÄ Push Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

4. **Log in to ACR using Azure CLI**  
   Replace with your actual ACR name:
   ```sh
   az acr login --name prodr9acosacrr9acos
   ```

5. **Push the backend image to ACR**  
   ```sh
   docker push prodr9acosacrr9acos.azurecr.io/backend:latest
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ Optional: Verify and Automate

- Confirm image exists in your ACR:
  ```sh
  az acr repository show-tags --name prodr9acosacrr9acos --repository backend
  ```

- Automate push in CI/CD pipeline using GitLab, GitHub Actions, or shell scripts.
